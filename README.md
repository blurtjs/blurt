## An IRC/XMPP client written in node.

The landscape of terminal based chat clients is dominated by weechat and irssi. Either client is extensible via a plugin system, yet neither supports plugins written in Javascript, ostensibly the most popular scripting language used today.

We decided to write a client entirely in Javascript, and expose its inner functionality via a rich API that allows extreme customization.

## We've only just begun

So far we're just working out the basics, laying out the main interface and architecture.
